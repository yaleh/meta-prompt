# Meta Prompt Demo

This project is a demonstration of the concept of Meta Prompt, which involves generating a language model prompt using another language model. The demo showcases how a language model can be used to generate high-quality prompts for another language model.

## Overview

The demo utilizes OpenAI's language models and provides a user interface for interacting with the chatbot. It allows users to input prompts, execute model calls, compare outputs, and optimize prompts based on desired criteria.

## Installation

To use this demo, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/meta-prompt-demo.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd meta-prompt-demo`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Please note that you need to have Python and pip installed on your system.

## Usage

To run the demo, execute the following command:

```
python main.py --api_key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key. Other optional parameters can be specified as well, such as proxy settings, model name, API base URL, maximum message length, sharing option, and advanced mode. Please refer to the command-line argument options in the script for more details.

Once the demo is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the user interface provided. Enter prompts, execute model calls, compare outputs, and explore the functionality of the Meta Prompt concept.
