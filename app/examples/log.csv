Low-noise amplifier,"A '''low-noise amplifier''' ('''LNA''') is an electronic component that amplifies a very low-power [[signal]] without significantly degrading its [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). Any [[electronic amplifier]] will increase the power of both the signal and the [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] present at its input, but the amplifier will also introduce some additional noise. LNAs are designed to minimize that additional noise, by choosing special components, operating points, and [[Circuit topology (electrical)|circuit topologies]]. Minimizing additional noise must balance with other design goals such as [[power gain]] and [[impedance matching]].

LNAs are found in [[Radio|radio communications]] systems, [[Amateur Radio]] stations, medical instruments and [[electronic test equipment]]. A typical LNA may supply a power gain of 100 (20&nbsp;[[decibels]] (dB)) while decreasing the SNR by less than a factor of two (a 3&nbsp;dB [[noise figure]] (NF)). Although LNAs are primarily concerned with weak signals that are just above the [[noise floor]], they must also consider the presence of larger signals that cause [[intermodulation distortion]].","* Consistent with Expected Output:

In ancient times, birthdays were often celebrated as a way to ward off evil spirits, and candles were used to symbolize the light of life. Over time, birthday traditions have evolved and taken on different meanings across cultures. Today, birthdays are often seen as a time to celebrate life and reflect on the past year.
